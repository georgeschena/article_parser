# ArticleParser allows to input a json of an article and return articles.
# It will need to have the following functions (in order of priority):
# Step 1. Return an article with a published date /
# Step 2. Allow to get a title (the first hl1) from an article /
# Step 3. Allow to retrieve the raw json body of the article (eventually to be used by clients) /
# Step 4. Be able to retrieve a brief summary in the article (defined by title + first paragraph) /

# Note:
# We don't expect strict types to be returned. Choose what you think that fits here.

  ## I have added this basic formater method to create web app ready HTML, which can then be spat into an html file.
  ## I have used Contentful before which when implemented in a project, enforces something similar to this.
  ##Â Here is a reference to work I have done at a previous role, relating to parsing content and presenting it on a webpage
  ## https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-book-secure-move-frontend/blob/main/common/services/contentful.ts
